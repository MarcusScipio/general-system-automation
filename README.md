# general-system-automation

NOTE: Monorepo

This repository contains various automation scripts developed over the years of my work, based on different systems: Windows, Linux, Mac.. along infrastructure automation with Jenkins &amp; other tools, for example. 


Feel free to use and re-design as you will, as many of these share a widely applicable concept. Some are more specific than others. 

Covers:
- Windows env automation
- Linux env automation
- CI/CD and custom scriptign with Groovy
